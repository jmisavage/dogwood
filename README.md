# Dogwood

A basic decision tree engine.

I'm building Dogwood to scratch a itch I and many of you have encountered having decision trees that change frequently or are so customized that they only solve one specific problem and has to be recreated for the next. The goal is to add a light-weight abstraction layer so the configuration and the logic can be used for multiple purposes.

The initial version will be totally offline, but in future major releases I plan on having a server component to handle async operations (like waiting for a background check to clear in several days).

## Why Dogwood

I wanted to name this project after a tree and Dogwoods happen to be my state's tree. Also it's available so I took it.
